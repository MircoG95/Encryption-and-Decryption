# Encryption-and-Decryption with C#

This project reads in a .txt. 
!!You have to change the path to test it!!


Here you can choose if you want to encrypt or decrypt the text content of a file. You must also specify a key yourself. With the same key you can undo the encryption. 

The file is saved after you have encrypted or decrypted it.
